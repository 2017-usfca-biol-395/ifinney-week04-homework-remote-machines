# Week 4 Homework Reflection

The most odd thing discovered when running my script was the fact that the output for the date was different from the actual time (Pacific Time). I searched on many different forums on Google to change the date manually but it seems that that is not possible. I do wonder what time they are tracking. It was interesting to see that some of the files had very long lines of sequences and sequence names. I thought it was a fault of my own but many of the other files has more condensed sequences so I just assumed that this was due to the format of the file itself and not a fault of my own. Hopefully everything is up to par with what the assignment is asking for but I feel like after many hours of trying to work this out and find solutions independently, I managed to get my script working and I feel sorta accomplished(finally)!!!
