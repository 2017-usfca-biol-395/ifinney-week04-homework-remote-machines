# This is bashscript for Week 4 homework assignment 
# This script will help in exploring and applying to
# different applications tmux, ssh, and git have to offer 

#The first portion of this script should output a log of some of the 
#information pertaining to the zip files in data

# A for loop hould help accomplish the second portion of this asignment which is
# to output information about each zip file



#cd data
#unzip FastaSeqCL.fasta.zip
#unzip H1N1_NS.fasta.zip
#unzip crab_mitochondrial_rRNA.fasta.zip
#unzip H1N1_HA.fasta.zip
#unzip H1N1_PA.fasta.zip
#unzip invertebrates_mRNA.fasta.zip
#unzip H1N1_MP.fasta.zip
#unzip H1N1_PB1.fasta.zip

#unzip H1N1_NA.fasta.zip
#unzip H1N1_PB2.fasta.zip
#unzip H1N1_NP.fasta.zip

echo "Unzipping fasta files"
# This code will output a series of quality checks and information about the fasta files present in data
